# Why C Language ?
C is the general purpose programming language. It is very important to learn and understand C irrespective of what programming languages you work on the daily basis. C forces programmers to utilize Stack memory instead Heap memory which in turn improves program's performance. C doesn't use any garbage collector, this is a good feature as well as a bad feature of C. Programmers need to manually allocate a block of memory and free it. Failing to free the allocated memory block would cause computer system to crash for this reason some extra precautions needs while writing programs in C. Learning C will help programmers to appreciate learning or working on high level programming languages such as Java, Python, JS, C# etc. Universities and colleges teach students in C. C is not a beginner friendly language, it takes some time to learn especially if you are coming from high level programming languages but it is worth learning it.
