# C Language
C is the general purpose programming language. It is very most important to learn and unerstand C language irresptice of 
what programming languages you work on daily basis. C forces programmers to utilize Stack memory instead Heap memoy which
in turn improves program's performance. C does't use any garbage, this is part of pros and cons of C language. Programmers
need to manually allocate block of memory and free it. Failing to free the blocked memory would cause computer system to crash.
Learning C will help programmers to appriciate learning or working on higher programming language such as Java, Python, JS, C# etc.
