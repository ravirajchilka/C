# Why C Language ?
C is the general purpose programming language. It is very most important to learn and unerstand C irresptice of 
what programming languages you work on the daily basis. C forces programmers to utilize Stack memory instead Heap memoy which
in turn improves program's performance. C does't use any garbage collector, this is a good feature as well as a bad feature of C. Programmers
need to manually allocate block of memory and free it. Failing to free the allocated memory block would cause computer system to crash for this reason
some extra precautions needs while writing programs in C.
Learning C will help programmers to appriciate learning or working on higher programming languages such as Java, Python, JS, C# etc.
