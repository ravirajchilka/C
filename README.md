# Why C Language ?
C is the general purpose programming language. It is very important to learn and understand C irrespective of what programming language you use in your workplace. C forces programmers to utilize Stack memory instead of Heap memory, which in turn improves a program's performance. C doesn't use any garbage collector, which is why C or C++ enables dynamic memory management. Programmers need to manually allocate a block of memory and free it. Failing to free the allocated memory block would cause the computer system to crash. For this reason, some extra precautions are needed while writing programs in C or C++. Learning C will help programmers to appreciate learning or working in high level programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, C# etc. Universities and colleges teach students in C. C is not a beginner-friendly language. It takes some time to learn, especially if you are coming from high-level programming languages, but it is worth learning.
